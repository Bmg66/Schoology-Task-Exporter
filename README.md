# Schoology-Task-Exporter
The Schoology Task Exporter Chrome extension allows you to export tasks from Schoology and copy them into a task management system such as Trello or Asa. This can help you keep track of your tasks in a more organized and efficient way.
This extension was developed as a fun project to make it easier to manage tasks between Schoology and other task management systems. Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are welcome!
